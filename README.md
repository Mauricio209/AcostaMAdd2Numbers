# AcostaMAdd2Numbers

Peer Review by; Pedro Castaneda - When you do exactly as the instructions say then the code runs good. Your number validation works perfectly. When you display to the user there sum you are concatinating the strings (numberOne + numberTwo) and its adding the strings not integers. You will need to instead use the ints (numOne + numTwo) so you can add the numbers properly. You will also need to declare your variables at the begining of your code so that they can get reset when user plays again. I would also suggest adding validation for you play again feature. Other than those things I think you code is looking really clean. Great work.
